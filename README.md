# Blockchain-Based To-Do List

A **secure, immutable to-do list** built on **blockchain principles**. This project uses **C++ and SHA-256 hashing** to create a **tamper-proof task management system**.

## Features 
✅ Blockchain structure with blocks & hashes  
✅ **Proof of Work** (Mining difficulty for security)  
✅ Saves & loads blockchain from a file  
✅ Prevents data tampering  
✅ Simple CLI interface for adding & viewing tasks  

## How to Run  
1. Install OpenSSL.
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o todo_list todo_list.cpp -lssl -lcrypto
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./todo_list
   ```

## Preview 
- **Add tasks securely**  
- **View your blockchain-powered to-do list**
